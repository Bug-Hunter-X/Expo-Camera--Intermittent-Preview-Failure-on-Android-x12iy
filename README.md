# Expo Camera Preview Issue on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API on certain Android devices. The camera preview may fail to load, resulting in a black screen or a distorted image. This issue appears to be related to hardware or Android system inconsistencies, as it's not consistently reproducible and doesn't generate specific error messages.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app using `expo start`.
3. Test on different Android devices to observe the inconsistent behavior.

## Potential Solutions (see bugSolution.js)

The solutions explored focus on permission checks, different camera types, and handling potential runtime errors.  However, a definitive solution depends on identifying the root cause of the underlying hardware/system incompatibility.
