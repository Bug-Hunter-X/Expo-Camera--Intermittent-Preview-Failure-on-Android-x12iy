This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component with certain Android devices.  The camera preview either fails to load entirely, displays a black screen, or shows a distorted image. This problem is intermittent and doesn't consistently reproduce across all devices, even those running the same Android version. The Expo Go app exhibits the same issue, suggesting it's not a code-specific problem but an incompatibility with some hardware or Android configurations.  No specific error messages are logged in the console.
